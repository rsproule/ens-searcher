# ENS Searcher

The original plan for this project was to also give the ability to register via a smart contract to snipe an ENS address whenever it expires. This was before the ENS governence bumped the "premium" fee up from $2,000 to 100,000. After this change, this strategy is less interesting. Still it is a useful enough interface for doing some manual research for upcoming expirees.
